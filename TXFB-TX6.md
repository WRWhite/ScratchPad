# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect TXFB-TX6 device running Debian GNU/Linux 8 (Jessie), kernel v4.4.0 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [TXFB-TX6 device](http://www.directinsight.co.uk/configurable-arm-based-sbcs)

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

The Triton TX6 module comes with a very light weight custom Linux distribution which is an ideal starting point for a headless device. Alternatively it is possible to install a Yocto image. For the purposes of evaluating the Azure IoT Hub SDK the easiest approach is to use a more full featured Debian distribution which is highly flexible and configurable.Once you have established the features required for your embedded system it is straight forward to roll them into either a Yocto build or use the native Karo Linux distribution.

- Install a Debian 8 (Jessie) distribution on the Triton TX6 module in the TXFB-TX6 board:

- Program the Debian 8 Jessie into the Triton TX6 module:

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY or Tera Term session and connect to the TXFB-TX6. Logon as the user debian. The password is debian.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo chown debian:debian /home/debian
        
        sudo chown debian:debian .*
        
        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre libssl-dev pkg-config

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

    {{**For AMQP protocol:**}}

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    {{**For HTTPS protocol:**}}

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c
        
     {{**For MQTT protocol:**}}

        nano azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    {{**If using AMQP protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    {{**If using HTTP protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http

    {{**If using MQTT protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/linux
  make -f makefile.linux all
  ```
